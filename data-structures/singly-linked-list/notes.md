# Singly Linked Lists

### Characteristics
- Has a head and tail
- Consists of nodes that hold a value
- Each node has a unidirectional pointer to the next node


### Pros
- Quick insertions & deletions


### Cons
- Slow access (can't immediately access at an index, has to traverse down the list)

## Singly Linked Lists vs Arrays
- Arrays are indexed in order, lists have no indexes
- Arrays can have expensive insertion/deletion because everything must be re-indexed
- Random access is quicker with arrays, as items can be accessed with a specific index
